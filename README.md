# LabWork â€“ C Language Programs (Basic Practice)

This repository contains practice programs of **C language** (Lab work) for basic concepts like conditional statements and loops.

Each file is named as **Q1, Q2, Q3...** along with its respective program.  
The following table describes what each file does:

| File | Description |
|------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Q1.c** | Program to find **largest of two numbers** |
| **Q2.c** | Program to **check whether a number is even or odd** |
| **Q3.c** | Program to find **largest of three numbers** |
| **Q4.c** | Program to **check whether a given year is a Leap Year** |
| **Q5.c** | Program to **print numbers from 1 to 100** using loop |
| **Q6.c** | Program to **find the Sum of first N natural numbers** |
| **Q7.c** | Program to **calculate the Product of first N natural numbers** (Factorial logic) |
| **Q8.c** | Program to **print Fibonacci series up to N terms** using loop |
